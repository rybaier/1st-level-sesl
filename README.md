The day has finally come: it's time to go to battle and tackle Level 1 of the Software Engineering Super League. In this email, you will find the challenge, how and where to submit it and any other tips for the first week of the SESL1. 

1. LEVEL 1 CHALLENGE

Chasing the Clicks

﻿

Build a web page (or any kind of hosted web app) with a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0 or any other default number.

﻿

You can earn bonus points for showing on the web page the distribution of clicks by geography. This could be a simple table, a map or any other way that you can think of.

﻿

Please note that we will not be evaluating your work based on design or aesthetics. While it’s important to have a sense of product design, we don’t want you to worry about the details of the user interface at the moment.

﻿

Your submission should be a link to a hosted web page. Here at Lighthall we are most familiar with React and Amplify, so we can provide the most guidance there, but you can use any tech stack that you feel comfortable with. 

﻿

Here are some resources that you are welcome to use to build and host your work:


Amplify: https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react/

Vercel: https://vercel.com/docs

Remix: https://remix.run/docs/en/1.15.0

React: https://react.dev/learn

2. SUBMISSION DEADLINE

This assignment is due on Friday, April 14th, at 8:00 PM EST (5:00 PM PST).

﻿

In the interest of fairness, we will have to be strict about deadlines, so please deliver your submissions on time. 

﻿

We will review all submissions over the weekend and announce who will advance to Level 2 by Monday, April 17th. Next week's challenge will be a team challenge.

3. HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK

Your submission should be a link to a hosted web page.

﻿

This week, you will find a sub-channel called #Level-1-Submissions in the Competition Group Chat of the Software Engineering Super League on Lighthall. 

﻿

When you are ready to submit, please post the link in that sub-channel. You will receive a confirmation response from our team, when it's been received.
